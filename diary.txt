Try this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21848801/cant-edit-crontab
The solution in the link works:
Use the env program to pass environment variables to crontab.
`sudo env EDITOR=nano crontab -e`

Run every five min: https://crontab.guru/#*/5_*_*_*_*

Need to also edit in Vim: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-vim-save-quit-exit

Was able to get a simple cron job to run every five minutes!
